Lessons from my CODING JOURNEY

In this article I document some important lessons I have learnt during my coding journey.
My coding journey
[2013] : Started learning HTML and CSS
[2013 - 2016] : Used HTML and CSS on my job as a web designer
[2016 - 2017] : Learnt Ruby on Rails
[2018 - 2019] : Learnt a bit Javascript and currently learning Python

## The best way to learn coding is to code
Practice makes one perfect. It is not enough to watch videos and read articles on coding. Try to write code even it brings up errors.Through your errors you polish your ability to write code.You learn by coding.

## Write code don't copy code
It is easier to copy code from online resources into your program. But this limits your ability to write your own when you don't have access to those resources.By writing code on your own you would get used to the programming language syntax easily.

## FOCUS! FOCUS!! FOCUS!!!
There are so many online resources to learn different programming languages. You need to be clear on your interests and priorities. You can then proceed to find the accurate resources to help you. 

## Join a community
Github provides you with a platform to search for development communities.You get better learning from what others have done.No matter your level you don't know it all.On Github you get access to the code of other programmers which you could copy and explore.

I would be adding more lessons here as time goes on.
